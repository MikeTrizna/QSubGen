cpu_time ==> CPU time ==> -l s_cpu= ==>
This is the amount of CPU time your job needs to complete, 
you can enter a time (any time limit) or select a queue length;
the format is MM or H:MM or HH:MM or D:HH:MM or DD:HH:MM.
---
memory ==> Memory ==> -l mres= ==>
This is the amount of memory *per CPU* your job will use (hence need).

The total amount of reserved memory will be  this amount MULTIPLIED by 
the number of CPUs allocated.

The cluster is a shared resource, memory is a limited and costly resource, 
so do not set this value to more than you will use.
Doing so will prevent access to that memory, hence other jobs from running!
---
pe ==> ==> -pe ==>
PE: parallel environment:
  * serial: 1 CPU/job;
  * MPI: message passing interface, CPUs can be on different nodes:
    orte and mpich are two flavors of MPI;
  * multi-thread: shared memory model, all CPUs  must be on the same node.
Note: high memory jobs PE can only be serial or multi-thread
---
nbr_cpu ==> Number of CPUs ==> -pe ==>
This is the number of CPUs/threads or slots your job will use:
  * MPI jobs can use a large number of CPUs, as they are distributed over nodes;
  * Multi-threaded jobs are limited to 64 or 24 threads, since all the threads
    need to be on the same node (low/high memory -> 64/24 CPUs).

The allocated number of slots will stored in the variable $NSLOTS
---
shell ==> ==>  ==> 
The choice of shell determines the syntax you use for your commands.
---
other ==> ==> ==> 
These are optional parameters.
---
job_name ==> Job Name ==> -N ==>
This is the name of your job, it can be any valid string
---
log_name ==> Log File Name ==> -o ==>
This is the filename where the output of your script will go 
make sure to use a unique filename for each concurrent job.

If the file exists, the output will be appended to the existing file
---
err_name ==> Err File Name ==> -e ==> 
This is the filename where the error messages of your script will go 
make sure to use a unique filename for each concurrent job.

If the file exists, the output will be appended to the existing file
---
email_add ==> Email ==> -M ==>
The email address to send job status notifications
---
add_modules ==> Select which modules to add: ==> ==>
Select from the list which modules your job will need.
---
job_commands ==> Job specific commands: ==> ==>
Enter here the commands for your job, you must follow the syntax of the
selected shell.
---
commands     ==> Type your commands here      ==>        ==> ---
goto_cwd     ==> Change to cwd                ==> -cwd   ==> ---
join_err     ==> Join stderr &amp; stdout     ==> -j y   ==> ---
send_email   ==> Send email notifications     ==> -m abe ==> ---
modules      ==> from this list               ==>        ==>
